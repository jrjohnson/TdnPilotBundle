TdnPilotBundle
==============
A pilot project generator (kick ass scaffolding) for [Symfony 2][symfony 2].  

###This bundle is no longer under active development, if you wish to take it over let me know.

Description
-----------
TdnPilotBundle is a <b>very opinionated</b> bundle that scaffolds
a restful application (or selected parts) from your doctrine entities.

##### Why opinionated?
While symfony by design leaves a lot of options opens to developers this bundle makes quite a
few assumptions as to how your application should be generated. It includes a number of bundles
that normally developers are free to not use in their application (or use an alternative).

##### Generated code features:
* Create working application from entities
* CRUD application that follows PSR-4
* Generated code follows SF2 Best practices
